Ximera is pronounced as
[chimera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)); the X is
a capital [chi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_(letter)).  The
project aims to provide a [free and open-source platform for
interactive textbooks](https://github.com/kisonecat/ximera); educators
build [courses](/courses/) on top of this platform by posting
activities to GitHub.  Key features of our platform include

* *A content conversion tool.* Textbook authors are not programmers, so Ximera converts traditional [LaTeX documents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) into activities for an interactive textbook.  This facilitates rapid creation and editing of engaging student experiences.
* *A content navigator.*  Navigation of a large document is a difficult task.  The platform includes a content navigator to let students move through the various activities within a course.
* *A JavaScript library.* Having  created quite a few  interactive elements already with JavaScript,  Ximera acts as a repository or library providing common functionality that can be used to produce virtual manipulatives.
