Ximera allows educators to author their own interactive lessons with
no programming experience. If you can write a LaTeX document, Ximera
empowers you to write an online interactive lesson.  Ximera activities
are easy to author, edit, and, since they are stored on a GitHub
repository, they are ripe for collaboration.
