In this repository, we hope to supply potential authors of Ximera
activities with all the resources they need to get started.


Contents of the repository

* documentation directory containing the documentation on how to write
  a Ximera activity. You will need to typeset the file

  activities in the classroom. This is surely incomplete at the
  moment, but it is our hope that over time these materials will grow.
